            Hello! I'm Tawonga Taibu, an aspiring softwware engineer with a background in computer science from high school.
            Over the past few months, I've gained experience with SQL, SQLite as well as working with HTML. My journey in tech
            started with a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes for software applications.My passions lie in crafting
            innovating solutions and exploring the intersection of technology and sustainability. I believe that technology can 
            change the way we look at problems since it can be stepping stone to innovative solutions.Through this passion, I am able 
            to keep up with the velocity of changes around the technology industry and ultimately work towards building a better 
            environment for all humanity. In as much as I can be invested in my work and passions, I really enjoy playing basketball and reading
            novels during my extra time. Basketball in particular helps me to socialize with other people and just refresh my mind from 
            the day to day problems we face as human beings.

        <h2>EDUCATIONAL BACKGORUND</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently looking forward to studying a BSc degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering upon completing my bootcamp and looking forward to 
            getting some work experience before I start a new academic year because I strongly believe any form of education has to be complimented by application 
            in order to harness a person's true potential. This would definitely help me stay updated about the growing trends around software engineering and technology 
            from different industries.I am also hoping to continue with my studies in research and academia particularly in the fields of ever-evolving fields of Generative 
            Artificial Intelligence and Renewable-Energy.
